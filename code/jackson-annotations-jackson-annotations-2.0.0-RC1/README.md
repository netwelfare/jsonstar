# Overview

This project contains core genera-purpose annotations for
Jackson Data Processor, used on value and handler types.
Only those annotations that have no dependencies to other core
packages are included here: so anything that does depend on
'jackson-databind' package are included in that package
and so forth.

Project contains versions 2.0 and above: source code for earlier (1.x) versions is available from [Codehaus](http://jackson.codehaus.org) SVN repository.
Note that with version 1.x these annotations were part of the 'core jar'.
